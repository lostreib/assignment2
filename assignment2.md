###Current day-to-day
I'm a *reporter* at Bloomberg News. I am creating a Bloomberg Terminal funcation that deals with college endowments. 

###Data examples
In the past, I've worked with **small** data sets to create listicles for online publication. For example, I've used data from the CDC, Census, etc. For work, I'm interested in the data in SEC proxy statements to calculate the compensation of CEOS

###Why DAT_20
I'd like to learn more about how to parse and analyze larger data sets

###Reading
The most frequent data-oriented material I read is the [NYTimes Upshot](http://www.nytimes.com/upshot/) vertical.
